# Second sprint

## To-do list
- Documentation
- Responsiveness
- Deeper data dive section
    ¬ start with one chart
    ¬ create two more when comfortable
- Testing
- Separate out components
- Clean up UI, so that it's clearer how to use the tabs


## Additional ideas
- Allow viewing of constructor & driver data by year
- Animation on front page
- Navbar or footer?
