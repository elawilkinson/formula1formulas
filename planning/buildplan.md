# Initial Plan 

## Headline
A Formula 1 nerd site which shows the correlation between a team's founding year and their current standing.

### MVP
- 'Get stats' button
- API called
- Teams, standing, founding year displayed 

Components:
- Get stats (button)
- Display (text)

### Further ideas
- Input (or dropdown?) which allows user to select a team
- Overtake stats 

-------------------------------------

# Second sprint

## To-do list
- Documentation (READme)
- Responsiveness
- Deeper data dive section
    ¬ start with one chart
    ¬ create two more when comfortable
- Testing
- Separate out components
- Clean up UI, so that it's clearer how to use the tabs
- Ensure fetch requests are working (not just static version)


-------------------------------------

# Final sprint
- Documentation (update READme, add comments where needed)
- Testing

------------


## Additional ideas
- Allow viewing of constructor & driver data by year
- Animation on front page
- Navbar or footer?


## NB
would need to add CI and REACT_APP_API_KEY to Netlify config if it called the API again.
