## Your task is to produce a simple web application.

Choose a free and openly available API on the internet (think weather data, stock information, or anything you want!) and produce a web application that consumes this data and displays it in a meaningful way.

Your web application may be stand-alone/static or include a simple web server.

Your submission should include all source code and assets, and any information/instruction required to allow us to build/install and run the submission.

You may provide us with a web link to the submission, a GitHub repo, a ZIP file, or by any other means that we can readily access.

Pay attention to error handling, testing, portability, and usability/presentation. The submission should be returned within a week. But do let us know if you need more time.

Use any language of your choice (ideally JavaScript/Typescript), and any third-party libraries/frameworks. This is your chance to show off both your creative side and your technical side!
